## Requirements

- **macOS 14.0+** (Apple Silicon & Intel supported)
- **Xcode 15+** for building
- **API key** from OpenAI or Groq

## Quick Start

### 1. Get API Keys

Sign up and get your API key: (only one of them is required, you choose)

- **OpenAI**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- **Groq**: https://console.groq.com/keys

### 2. Clone and Build

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd VTS
open VTSApp.xcodeproj
```

### 3. Run the App

1. In Xcode, select the **VTSApp** scheme
2. Build and run with **‚åòR**
3. Grant microphone permission when prompted

## Usage

### Basic Transcription
1. **Choose Provider**: Select OpenAI or Groq from the dropdown
2. **Select Model**: Pick whisper-1, whisper-large-v3, or other available models
3. **Enter API Key**: Paste your API key in the secure field
4. **Start Recording**: Press the global hotkey (default: ‚åò‚áß;) and speak
5. **View Results**: See real-time transcription inserted into the application you're using
6. **(Optional) Copy**: Use buttons to copy the transcript

### Advanced Features

#### Microphone Priority Management
- **View Available Devices**: See all connected microphones with system default indicators
- **Set Priority Order**: Add devices to priority list with + buttons
- **Automatic Fallback**: App automatically uses highest-priority available device
- **Real-time Switching**: Seamlessly switches when preferred devices connect/disconnect
- **Remove from Priority**: Use ‚àí buttons to remove devices from priority list

#### Custom System Prompts
- Add context-specific prompts to improve transcription accuracy
- Examples: "Medical terminology", "Technical jargon", "Names: John, Sarah, Mike"
- Prompts help the AI better understand domain-specific language

## Architecture

VTS follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **CaptureEngine**: Handles audio capture using AVAudioEngine with Core Audio device management
- **DeviceManager**: Manages microphone priority lists and automatic device selection
- **TranscriptionService**: Orchestrates streaming transcription with provider abstraction
- **STTProvider Protocol**: Clean interface allowing easy addition of new providers
- **Modern SwiftUI**: Reactive UI with proper state management and real-time updates

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Open in Xcode (recommended)
open VTSApp.xcodeproj

# Or build via command line
xcodebuild -project VTSApp.xcodeproj -scheme VTSApp build
```

### Testing

Currently, VTS includes manual testing capabilities through the built-in Text Injection Test Suite accessible from the app's interface. This allows you to test text insertion functionality across different applications.

Automated unit tests are planned for future releases.

## Troubleshooting

### Microphone Issues
- **Permission Denied**: Check System Settings > Privacy & Security > Microphone
- **No Devices Found**: Click "Refresh" in Microphone Priority section
- **Wrong Device Active**: Set priority order or check device connections

### Accessibility Permissions (Development)
- **Permission Not Updating**: During development/testing, when the app changes (rebuild, code changes), macOS treats it as a "new" app
- **Solution**: Remove the old app entry from System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility, then re-grant permission
- **Why This Happens**: Each build gets a different signature, so macOS sees it as a different application
- **Quick Fix**: Check the app list in Accessibility settings and remove any old/duplicate VTS entries

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Onboarding**: Onboarding flow to help users get started.
- [ ] **Notarization and code signing**: Notarization and code signing are required to run the app on macOS.
- [ ] **Auto-open at login**: Auto-open at login. (Maybe a checkbox in the preferences window?)
- [ ] **Auto-update System**: Seamless updates via Sparkle framework

### In a future or maybe pro version, to be decided
- [ ] **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Automated unit tests covering:
  - Core transcription functionality
  - Provider validation and error handling  
  - Device management and priority logic
  - Integration flows and edge cases
- [ ] **LLM step**: Use LLM to process the transcription and improve accuracy, maybe targetted to the app you're using or context in general. (Be able to easily input emojis?)
- [ ] **Advanced Audio Processing**: Noise reduction and gain control, but also some STT providers can do this so maybe not needed?.
- [ ] **Accessibility Features**: VoiceOver support and high contrast modes
